"""
chain.py — Python <-> Rust bridge for the append-only verifiable ledger
(blockchain/, crate `sombra-chain`).

WHAT THIS IS. A private, single-node, append-only verifiable ledger. There
is one writer (this bot's host), no peers, no networking, no mining and no
consensus — so it is deliberately NOT described as a decentralized
blockchain anywhere in this codebase or in any user-facing Thai text.

WHAT IT IS NOT. Not a cryptocurrency, not a payment rail, not a second
source of truth for anybody's balance. `bot.db` remains the only place a
balance lives, and nothing in this module or in the Rust crate ever writes
to `wallets`, `wallet_transactions`, `debt_entries` or `expenses`.

HOW IT INTEGRATES — ANCHOR (PULL), NOT DUAL-WRITE. wallet.py,
debt_ledger.py and expense.py are not modified at all. The Rust binary
*reads* rows those modules have already committed and appends them to the
chain. The task brief's three consistency hazards are therefore structurally
impossible rather than merely handled:
  - "balance and ledger disagree": no balance is ever computed here;
  - "chain committed, database failed": the chain can only record rows the
    database already committed;
  - "database committed, chain failed": the chain lags and the next anchor
    run catches up, because every anchor is keyed by a deterministic
    `tx_ref` with a UNIQUE index and is therefore idempotent.
Recovery after a crash, a kill -9, or a week with the binary missing is the
same single action: run `anchor` again.

INTEGRATION STYLE — CLI over subprocess. Chosen over PyO3 bindings (which
would put a Rust toolchain in the critical path of every `pip install`) and
over a local service (a second process to supervise for something that runs
a few times an hour). The binary is also runnable by hand during debugging.

DEGRADED MODE IS A FIRST-CLASS PATH. If the binary is missing, not
executable, times out, crashes, or returns unparseable output, every
function here returns an OpResult-shaped failure and the bot carries on
exactly as before. This module raises nothing; the Telegram bot must never
go down because a ledger component is unhappy. That matters especially on
first deploy, when the Rust binary may not have been built yet.

Design constraints (matches security.py / wallet.py / expense.py):
- Standard library only (asyncio, json, logging, os, shutil, subprocess),
  plus `from security import DB_PATH` -- exactly what every other data-layer
  module here does. Hard-coding a second "bot.db" literal would mean that
  the day someone repoints security.DB_PATH, the ledger would silently keep
  anchoring the old database while the bot wrote to the new one.
- Owns no tables: the Rust crate creates and owns `chain_blocks`,
  `chain_transactions` and `chain_meta` inside the existing `bot.db`.
- No LLM calls, no network.
